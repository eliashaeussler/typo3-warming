What does it do?
================

The extension provides a service to warm up Frontend caches based on XML
sitemaps. Cache warmup can be triggered in various ways:

-   From the :ref:`TYPO3 backend <backend-toolbar>`
-   Using a :ref:`console command <console-commands>`
-   Directly with the :ref:`PHP API <using-the-api>`

It supports multiple languages and custom crawler implementations.
Under the hood, the extension makes use of the
`eliashaeussler/cache-warmup <https://github.com/eliashaeussler/cache-warmup>`__
library which provides the core cache warmup implementation. In addition,
`EXT:sitemap_locator <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sitemap_locator>`__
is used to locate XML sitemaps.
