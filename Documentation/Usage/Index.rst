.. note::

    Currently it is not possible to use more than one XML sitemap per
    site and language for the cache warmup.

This section describes how to properly use the extension in various ways.
Basically the cache warming can be executed in two different modes: Either
for whole sites based on their XML sitemap or for single pages based on
their page ID.
