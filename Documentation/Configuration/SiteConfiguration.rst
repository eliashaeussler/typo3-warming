Site configuration
==================

.. important::

    Caches can be warmed up only if the entry point of the site
    contains the full domain name.

The cache warmup is based of the configured sites in the TYPO3 installation.
Therefore, in order to control the cache warmup behavior, the site configuration can
be used. The following configuration options are available for this purpose:

.. confval:: xml_sitemap_path (site)

    :Path: xml_sitemap_path
    :type: string

    Path to the XML sitemap of the configured site's base language. It
    must be relative to the entry point of the site.

.. confval:: xml_sitemap_path (site_language)

    :Path: languages > (site language) > xml_sitemap_path
    :type: string

    Path to the XML sitemap of an additional site language. It must be
    relative to the entry point of the site language.

    Take a look at :ref:`sitemap-providers` to learn how the extension
    internally evaluates the site configuration values to determine the
    path to the XML sitemap of a site.
