    `Feature #338 â€“ Introduce events <https://github.com/eliashaeussler/typo3-warming/issues/338>`__

During cache warmup, some :ref:`PSR-14 events <t3coreapi:EventDispatcher>`
are dispatched. Events can be used to step in the cache warmup
lifecycle and affect its crawling behavior in various ways.

..  note::
    The `eliashaeussler/cache-warmup` library also dispatches some events.
    Read more in the `official documentation <https://cache-warmup.dev/api/events.html>`__.

The following events are currently dispatched:

..  _before-cache-warmup-event:

BeforeCacheWarmupEvent
======================

This event is dispatched right before cache warmup is triggered
via :php:`\EliasHaeussler\CacheWarmup\CacheWarmer::run`. It
allows to add additional sitemaps and URLs to the cache warmer or
modify the crawling behavior in other ways.

..  _after-cache-warmup-event:

AfterCacheWarmupEvent
=====================

Once cache warmup is finished, this event is dispatched. It
provides the cache warmup result together with the original
instance of :php:`\EliasHaeussler\CacheWarmup\CacheWarmer`
and the used crawler.
